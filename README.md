# Hardhat VSCode feedback

This is a temporary repository to collect feedback about the Hardhat VSCode extension during its beta program.

## Feedback

If you are part of the beta and want to report an issue, suggest an improvement, ask a question about the extension, or request a new feature, please open an issue. 

Including clear instructions to reproduce your issue and example code (preferably a link to a repository) would be much appreciated.

## Installing the extension

The extension is distributed privately at the moment. We are going to gradually increase the number of users who have access to Hardhat VSCode to be sure we are able to process all the feedback we receive.

Once you are included in the beta program, one of our team members will send you instructions about how to install the extension through [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
